**This project will release April 1st 2025.**

Theme: ???

### Goals
I would like to add variations to a bunch of the vanilla mobs.  
In mclmaf2024, I only made the moobloom (and variants) due to a lack of time.

I would like to try and have variations of passive, neutral, and hostile mobs.
- A system that converts the vanilla mobs into the modded mobs.
  - And possibly a way to convert them back.
- Custom sounds for the variations.
