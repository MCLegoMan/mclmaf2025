## Steve Co. Supply Crates  
We took the "Steve Co. Supply Crates" (also known as "Locked Chests") from Minecraft Beta 1.4,
and made them link to the actual minecraft shop. See [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Locked_chest) for more info on the original!  
This mod contains a reference to "Supply Crates" (a.k.a "Loot Boxes", "Crates", or "Gambling"), which we do not support, nor do we endorse the use of these for exchange of real-world currency. These are predatory practices designed to cause harm, and we encourage you to avoid them.  
This reference was intended to make fun of the companies that use these predatory practices.
